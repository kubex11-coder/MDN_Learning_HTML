  <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
  <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, <strong>with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
  <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads. </p>
  <p>ingedients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (<i>garbanzo beans</i>)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li> 1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Instructions</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li> Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
      <ul>
        <li><em>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</em></li>
        <li>If you want a <em><strong>smooth hummus</em></strong>, process it for a longer time</li>
      </ul>
    <li> If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
  </b></p>
  <h2>Storage</h2>
  <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
  <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
